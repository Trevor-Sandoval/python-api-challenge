# python-api-challenge


## PLEASE NOTE that my 2 scripts (VacationPy.ipynb and WeatherPy.ipynb) can be found in the folder entitled "WeatherPy_and_VacationPy"


INSTRUCTIONS: 
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.


Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python library Links to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap API Links to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities. For this part, you'll use the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide you through the process of using your Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities. To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.
-- Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
-- Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship





References: Please note that some portions of my code's structure were inspired by my research on the internet in addition to the hyperlinked module resources emailed to us by Melissa Conner. At the beginning of this boot camp, we were encouraged to be proactive with utilizing the internet as a resource for finding solutions to complex problems that also contributed to our edification. Thus, I was able to formulate my assignment after conducting some independent research on Stack Overflow and Google Search.
